The list price is the initial or advertised price of a product before any discounts, taxes, or additional fees are applied. The total price is the final amount the customer actually pays, which includes all relevant adjustments. 
List Price
The list price, also known as the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) or catalog price, is a baseline price set by the manufacturer or seller. It's used as a starting point for transactions and negotiations and helps communicate the product's general value to consumers. 
Total Price
The total price (sometimes called the net price or sales price) is the actual cost to the buyer at the completion of a purchase. It is calculated by taking the list price and factoring in all other pricing elements. 
To calculate the total price from the list price, you must account for the following factors:
Discounts: Subtract any trade discounts, promotions, or coupons from the list price.
Quantity: The total price for multiple items is the unit price multiplied by the number of units purchased.
Taxes: Add applicable sales taxes, Goods and Services Tax (GST), or value-added taxes (VAT).
Fees: Include any additional fixed or variable charges, such as shipping, handling, installation, or recycling fees. 
The general formula is:
Total Price = (List Price - Discounts) + Taxes + Additional Fees
When entering a list price in a system or transaction, it serves as the foundation upon which all these other calculations build to arrive at the final, total price the customer will be charged.
